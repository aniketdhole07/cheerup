A 3-D Printed Bot which can talk, cheer, dance and manage your day-to-day schedule.

In childhood many of us have watched this show "SpongeBob Squarepants" , got inspired from it to create a virtual assistant to get our daily schedule and even cheer us up in this difficult time of work. 

Instead of depending on phones for watching schedule we often get distracted , so using CheerUp we can avoid such distraction and work efficiently.

The Bot is Made from:

1. M5Stack Core 2 - It is a ESP32 based device which has peripheral devices like TOuch DIsplay Screen, Speaker, Microphone, LEDs, Accelerometer,SD Card Slot.

2. Servo Motors: These are used to actuate the arms of the bot.

3. 3D Printed Parts and Paints:  All the printed parts are the main attraction of this device , you can paint if you want.

4. SD Card: It is used to store the images and audio file of bot.

Features:

1. The device can be used even without constant supply of USB power as it has inbuilt battery.
